The orb is double layered, meaning that there is an air layer in between two inflatable orbs (this acts as a shock absorber and ensures that it is safe). If you are looking for a sport that will leave you dizzy, disorientated, full of adrenaline and in hysterics, then this is the one for you.",

Air Kicking is essentially being catapulted through the air into a swimming pool or foam pit, and although it is safe you can be sure that it will get your adrenaline pumping. You are shot into the sky through the air in a pre-calculated parabolic trajectory which uses air pressure and water recoil technology. Around 60 liters of water are forced through a nozzle under the seat, which will fire participants around 26 feet into the air before crashing down into the water. It looks great fun, and it is also quite the spectacle to watch too.",

Watching someone limbo under a bar just a few inches off the ground is incredible enough, but to do this on skates is even more impressive as they have to spread their legs apart and retain their balance. A 6-year-old from India, Gagan Satish, broke the world record in 2014 by limbo skating under 39 cars that were parked just five inches off the ground. The feat took him just 29 seconds to cover around 230 feet, and the video is truly an amazing watch. Although not as extreme as some of the other entries, limbo skating certainly carries risk and is a strange yet entertaining sport.",

title: "Wing Walking",
description: "There are few experiences which would be as adrenaline pumping and as extreme as walking on the wings of a plane mid-flight, and this has developed into a popular extreme sport/activity called wing walking. Typically, the individual will be strapped to the top wing of a vintage biplane where you will then be swept through the skies at speeds of up to 135 mph and you will often have a pilot that will perform a range of acrobatic manoeuvres too. This is not a particularly dangerous extreme sport as you are strapped to the plane, but you can be sure that it is the ultimate thrill ride and something that will have your heart in your mouth throughout.",

title: "Volcano Boarding",
description: "Hurtling down an active volcano on a thin piece of board or metal may sound like something out of a James Bond film, but it has in fact become a hugely popular extreme sport and is practiced by many. The sport is most popular on Nicaragua’s Cerro Negro, and this sees participants travelling down from 726 metres and reaching astonishing speeds of up to 50 mph. Like most extreme sports, safety gear is very important and ensures that injuries are often just scratches and bruises. Then again, there is the threat of an eruption and having molten lava flowing down the volcano which not even 007 could evade.",

title: "Cliff Diving",
description: "As the name implies, this crazy extreme sport involves throwing yourself off of cliffs from a great height into the sea below. There are many great benefits to this extreme sport, such as seeing some stunning sights in beautiful areas of the world, free-falling through the air will give you a huge adrenaline rush, you will feel at one with nature and there is no special clothing/equipment to buy. It is of course highly dangerous though and can put great strain on your body. The impact when you hit the water can be enough to break bones or compress your spine, but there are then rocks, branches and fish to consider when landing which can cause fatalities. You must always enter the water feet-first in a vertical line to break through the water easier, and any other landing will always result in injury or even death.",

title: "Ropeless High Lining",
description: "Slack lining could be described as urban tightrope walking. Whilst some people will practice this with the line a few feet off the ground, there are also those extreme characters that take things to the next level by slack lining across cliff tops and other dangerous areas (this is called high lining). The person walking the rope will usually have a harness attached to the rope itself, but this does not guarantee safety as if you were to fall near the start or towards the end you could swing into the cliff side and if you fall in the middle could cause the rope to fail. High lining provides an incredible thrill however which is what makes it so popular, and in addition to this it ensures for some stunning views which nobody may have seen before.",

title: "Wingsuit Flying",
description: "At one point or another, everyone has imagined what it would be like to soar through the sky. With wingsuit flying you can discover this feeling, and the extreme sport is a combination of diving and hang gliding where the individual dons a wingsuit, which looks very much like a flying squirrel. This suit adds a large amount of surface area to the body, so that when you jump from a high altitude and spread your arms and legs you get an increase in lift which allows you to fly. A parachute is then required to land much like sky diving. There are many risks attached to wingsuit flying, but it is also the closest that you will come to flying through the air like a superhero, or at least like a flying squirrel.",

description: "The creator of Train Surfing has clearly seen one too many action films, and this is a sport which is also illegal around the world. Train Surfing involves climbing onto the roof of a train and “surfing” it as it moves at great speeds, and needless to say it is incredibly dangerous. Train Surfing is a huge problem is South Africa and many people have been killed attempting it. It was popular in the 80s and 90s, and once again resurfaced in 2005 after someone only known as “The Trainrider” surfed atop the InterCityExpress, the fastest train in Germany. A few years later, 40 German teenagers died attempting this wild and dangerous activity/sport which is perhaps one step too far.",
